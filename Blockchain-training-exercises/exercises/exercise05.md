# Taking A Look At Our Structure

Our current code structure is broken down into 2 main repositories, *Builder* and *Cold*. (CRT-BUILDERS, CRT-COLD)

Each coin receives its own builder in CRT-BUIDLERS and its own profile in CRT-COLD. 


## Your Task

Your task is to implement a cold implementation of Ethereum with our repos structures.

A partial version of our project structure is provided in 2 .zip files. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the structure before diving in.


> *Task* Using your code from the [previous exercise](./exercise04.md) fill out the structure provided to build a new Ethereum cold wallet. Using [this](https://github.com/Blockchain-Research-Team/blockchain-training/blob/main/extras/TrainingStructure.zip) zip file of our structure to create your wallet. 

Here is a mostly complete UML diagram of our current wallet structure. While the given zip file is modified from this form, use these diagrams as a guide to create your custody wallet.
